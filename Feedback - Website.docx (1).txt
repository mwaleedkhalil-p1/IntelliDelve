Client Case Study: TimeFocus Prevents High-Risk Hire with IntelliDelve’s Global Background Screening
Background
TimeFocus, a multinational workforce and technology consulting firm, manages sensitive projects for clients across the automotive, AI, and defense sectors. During a routine hiring cycle, the company received an
application for a senior technical role—a position that would grant the candidate access to intellectual property, source code, and internal security protocols.

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)

The Challenge
At first glance, the candidate’s profile appeared impressive:

High-profile experience with a well-known EV company
Multiple verified-seeming employment letters

●​
●​
●​

Most importantly, the candidate was discovered to have an active criminal record during the exact period of the claimed employment

TimeFocus immediately withdrew the offer, averting what could have been a major compliance, reputational, and security risk.

Client Case Study:Preventing Passport Risk: How a Leading CBI Program Averted a National
Scandal with IntelliDelve
We recently spoke with the Head of Risk & Compliance for one of our clients regarding Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) cases to understand how their partnership with IntelliDelve helped avoid granting citizenship to
a high-risk applicant.

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)
Why did you choose IntelliDelve as your enhanced due diligence partner?
As one of the top CBI programs in the region, we receive applications from high-net-worth individuals worldwide. While we conduct our own screening, we realized there were blind spots, particularly when it came to
identifying red flags hidden across multiple jurisdictions. One applicant stood out. On paper, everything checked out: significant investment, a clean passport, and no legal alerts. But something didn’t sit right with our
committee.
That’s when we brought in IntelliDelve.
What impressed us was their global intelligence reach. Within a matter of days, IntelliDelve uncovered:
●​
●​

The applicant had used multiple aliases.
A criminal conviction under a different identity for procurement fraud.

Ownership of shell companies used to channel money through tax havens.
Negative media exposure in multiple languages that didn’t show up in basic English-language searches.
These were serious risks we would have missed without their multi-layered forensic screening.

How has this partnership changed your risk mitigation approach?
Before IntelliDelve, we relied heavily on local data sources and traditional document checks. But today, with sophisticated fraud tactics in play, that’s not enough. Applicants can create entire backstories with forged
documents, planted online profiles, and cleansed reputations.

With IntelliDelve, we now screen for:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Verification Ownership and Multimillion dollar project records
Cross-border criminal and legal records
Politically Exposed Person and sanctions exposure
Historical address inconsistencies and travel patterns

We’ve integrated their services directly into our approval pipeline. As a result, our committee is more confident and our rejection rate for high-risk profiles has increased by 34%, improving program credibility.
“CBI programs are under global scrutiny. We can’t afford mistakes. IntelliDelve has become essential to our vetting process.”

How do you justify cost and value to your oversight board?
Reputation is our currency. One scandal could jeopardize the entire program. When we showed the board how IntelliDelve flagged a previously undetected fraud case—despite the applicant having pristine
documents—they understood the ROI instantly.

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)
We estimate that preventing just one bad citizenship approval could save millions in future legal costs, diplomatic fallout, and reputational damage.

CBI & IntelliDelve Partnership Breakdown
●​
●​
●​

Fully integrated into pre-approval pipeline
34% increase in red-flag detection year-over-year
Over 17 flagged applications prevented from approval in the past 12 months

Do you believe this has restored trust in your program?
Absolutely. International observers and partner governments want transparency. Since working with IntelliDelve, we’ve been able to publish risk-mitigation statistics and show proof of rejected high-risk cases. That
transparency has given our program legitimacy.
Most applicants never realize they’re being screened at this depth—but the ones who intend fraud do, and they stay away.
We’re not just issuing passports. We’re issuing trust. And IntelliDelve is our first line of defense.

Client Case Study: Uncovering Credential Fraud During a Critical Healthcare Staffing Crisis
We recently spoke with the Chief Medical Officer of a private hospital group who shared how IntelliDelve's credential verification prevented a near disaster during an urgent hiring cycle.

Why did you choose IntelliDelve for emergency credential screening?

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)
During the post-pandemic recovery phase, we faced immense pressure to hire specialists rapidly. One candidate came highly recommended and claimed to hold medical licenses from three countries, including the
UK. Their references were glowing, and the resume looked authentic.
But to avoid reputational and legal risks, we routed the application through IntelliDelve.
Within 48 hours, IntelliDelve's screening revealed:
●​
●​
●​

Two of the claimed licenses were forged.
The UK license had been revoked for malpractice.
The candidate was under investigation for negligence in another country.

How has this screening transformed your vetting process?
We now conduct:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Primary source license verification
Cross-border regulatory checks (OIG, GMC, HHS databases)
Sanction and exclusion list reviews

Client Case Study: Upholding Global Reputation: How Pakistani Universities Strengthen Overseas
Admissions Integrity with IntelliDelve

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)
We spoke with the Head of International Programs at a prominent university about how IntelliDelve is helping them verify outgoing students’ credentials and protect their institution’s credibility abroad.

Why did you adopt IntelliDelve for outbound student verification?
In recent years, several students applying for foreign admissions—especially in Australia, the UK, and Canada—have been found using altered transcripts, fake IELTS results, or unverifiable reference letters. This not
only harmed the individual’s visa prospects but damaged the reputation of sending institutions across the country.
Our goal was clear: we needed a trusted partner who could authenticate every record before submission to international admissions offices. IntelliDelve provided exactly that—without delay or compromise.
With their support, we implemented:
●​
●​
●​

Source-verifiable credential checks with local and international boards
Language test certificate validation directly with issuing bodies
Applicant behavioral profiling to detect repeat offender patterns

What improvements did you observe?
In the first academic cycle:
●​
●​
●​

11% of applicants were flagged for forged or exaggerated claims
3 educational consultants were flagged for unethical document handling
Partner institutions abroad reported increased trust in our verification reports

“When a student from Pakistan applies abroad, they carry not only their name—but ours. IntelliDelve ensures that name stands for truth.”

Client Case Study: Flying Safe: How IntelliDelve Helped Flag a High-Risk Pilot Applicant
We spoke with the Compliance Lead of a regional airline about how IntelliDelve’s aviation-grade vetting saved them from a potentially catastrophic hiring mistake.

Feedback (IntelliDelve Rebuilt Website)
What prompted the need for third-party vetting?
We were hiring for multiple pilot positions. One applicant presented strong flight hours and licenses across Asia and the Middle East. But a gut feeling prompted us to request enhanced screening.
What IntelliDelve found shocked us:
●​
●​
●​
●​

One of the licenses was purchased using a forged CAA document.
The applicant had been suspended in another country due to substance abuse.
No valid address history matched the ID provided.
Pilots had a bad reputation in their previous organizations.

What has changed in your compliance process?
We’ve implemented IntelliDelve’s aviation-specific solution:
